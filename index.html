    <!-- <h3><script>`Hello ${userName}`;</script></h3> -->
    <p>I am originally from California, though I now live in Virginia. "It's been a long road, geting from there to here". I met my wife at my last job in Vancouver Washington. A Job that was supposed to last 3 weeks, but instead lasted 4 years. I ended up living in Vancouver for 7 years total, having a two kids, and finally moving out here to Virginia. We're homesteaders here on 75 acres. While I am pretty decrepit, I get stuff accomplished the one or two hours of physical labor a day my back has in it. Yea, it is slow moving, but it will all be worth it in the end and the kids love it. We have all the creature comforts, electricity, internet, bathroom facilities, so it isn't bad. I've wanted to get back in to programming in a serious way for years, but we've always been on the precipice of moving, or getting set up here. While we still have a long way to go, it felt like a good and settled enough time to start working on that desire.</p>
